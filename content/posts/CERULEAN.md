# ME AND HER

The first thing that drew me to her was her smell. It was nasty, even more repugnant because I was born vegetarian , and I hated the smell of fish. 

But not her smell, I was almost excited about it. When her scent filled my nostrils,  I took a big breath in. Ah. 

Maybe it was because I had lived in the mountains all my life, so a bit of water excited me. 

But she wasn’t a bit of water you see.  She was vast , and unending and beautifully blue, depending on her mood. She always overpowered my senses with her splendor. I called her Cerulean.

The time I smelled her, I was in a bus heading to Cape Coast with my father. I fail to recall exactly the reason we were going to Cape Coast. 

But I remember pestering my father to take me to her. I remember us parking at a bank, in the area where the castle was, and getting coconuts. 

We walked hand in hand to her. I was exhilarated because I had seen her everywhere but in person.

I let go of my father’s hand and rushed to her. Cerulean sent me running back with a big wave. 

But I was relentless. 

My father held me to him when the waves came again.  I felt her rushing around my toes. It tickled. When she was drawing back the sand between my toes, I felt such a rush. I beamed so much the rest of the day , I woke up with hurting cheeks.

That’s how our relationship started, me and her.  

She did not mind sharing me with others too , because she propelled my first kiss. It was with a boy I had a crush on in my class. 

We had gone to discuss a group assignment over *kelewele* and coke, but when we were about to leave, she called to me. 

Then I told him I needed to sit with her for a few. He came to sit behind me. 

It was just us, her and the night. The crabs fascinated us, they came in pairs with their funny pointed eyes. We decided they were crab couples returning from a sex convention. Then we saw two crabs joined at the hip, I laughed,  then he suddenly turned me around and kissed me. 

Cerulean became ours, me and him, we were a triad. 

Until I caught him cheating on me with another one of our mates at the beach. I wasn’t even hurt by the fact that he was gay, but why did he not tell me he was enamored with another. 

My first heartbreak. 

Now, going to the beach, only reminded me of how she allowed him to cheat on me. Why did she not drown them both? Why did she watch somebody break my heart? Did she not love me? Being betrayed by the humans was something I could handle. But feeling betrayed by her was something my brain could just not process. 

I stayed away from her for weeks. I ached for her touch, to feel her envelope my senses , to hide in her. I was aching but I also did not want to give her the satisfaction of seeing me. 

I suffered in silence for weeks . 

Then the dreams started. They were happy dreams. Sunshine and rainbows and her. She was even more beautiful than I had imagined. Her hair floated  in bubbles, Like  giant chartreuse dreadlocks adorned with seashells and starfish. She had the curves of a seasoned *Fante* auntie, cinched waist, huge bum, palm sized breasts. 

Cerulean appeared in flashes, and she’d try to speak to me but I’d ignore her. I put them down as my overactive imagination making me hallucinate. One of those nights, she came to me, she looked so forlorn , I could not ignore her. She reached out to me with outstretched hands and gently pulled me into an embrace. My walls broke and I sob. My body shook from the force of the emotions that got ousted. 

She held me and cooed in my ear,  then she gave me an orgasm.

I woke up to a flooded room. It hadn’t rained the night before and there was no water outlet in my room. I was convinced it was Cerulean. I mopped up before my dad could ask questions. 

She never came back to me after that. It was my turn to hyper fixate. I wanted more of what she gave me . I waited a week for her to come, I could have gone to see her, but my heart pulled at the thought of reliving my heartbreak. On the eighth day , she came to me. 

That night she came to me, I asked her to give me another orgasm. She told me she could only do it once in a dream. If I wanted more, I should come meet her in person. She asked that I came to her at 12 am the next day, the moon would be full and there were a lot of things she could do with a full moon. All logical thoughts I had flew out the window. I told my dad I was going to sleep over at my childhood friend’s. If he had a problem, he was not vocal about it. 

I was giddy. I left home at 10pm and decided to go to the beach, farthest from my house. 

I got to Cerulean at 11:45 am , then I sat in the lotus position and waited.

At 12:00am , I saw a figure rise out of the water. She was majestic, navy blue shimmery skin, golden necklaces and bracelets. She wore a bikini made out of sea weeds. She walked towards me.

My mouth agape, she held out her hand to me and asked that I took it. When I did, I felt something leave me , then I could not disconnect myself from her anymore. She lay me on my back and  kissed me, she did things to me with a starfish.   Things I have been forbidden to utter, But things that brought me the utmost pleasure. 

That’s all I can remember from that night, Pleasure. In the most extreme and most subtle ways.

I woke up the next morning next to Cerulean, covered in sea weeds. She told me she had a gift for me. And then she gave me a diamond studded mirror. I wondered what it was for. 

I saw a man in the mirror. He was old and frail and leaning on a walking stick. What did this man have to do with me? She told me to look again. 

Dad?.
