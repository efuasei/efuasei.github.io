# Talia and the Supagetti

My Natalia,

She lay on the other side of the bed, breathing , softly.  

Her chest rising ,almost not. She looked not evil.  

She filled my brain with pictures of birds, green and red. Images of blue flowers swinging by their stalks on vines; multi-colored snakes wrapped in the vines.

Looking at her made me itch for my brushes. I wanted to paint on her skin.

I wanted to swoop some yellows and brush them gently across her stomach. Down to where the colors would merge in a pretty swirl. 

I wanted to drip drop purple paint on her nipples , neon green too,  then spread the paint around her areola, not with a brush this time. My tongue maybe , or my finger. She’d love that.

The sun seeped in through the diagonal slashes in the wooden window. The fire in the sun lit up her locs, pretty.

I felt her touch me. She wanted cuddles.

I pulled her into me, thigh between her legs. She smiled. A satisfied cat. I wanted to paint her, but she would not let me up. 

The first time we met was , yesterday , in the mall . I was heartbroken and on a grief shopping haul. 

I bumped into her at the ceramics section. She was looking at mugs. We both reached out for the yoda mug. I got to it first, she looked like she wanted to cry. 

I told her to have it. Then she asked for my number. We started talking afterwards. I invited her home. 

Your typical love story. Now, I am in no mood to finish this? 

Maybe one day inspiration will hit me.

Just know that I love her and I did not mean to bash her head in or fry her brains up for the spaghetti I’m eating now. 

Pro tip: Add locust beans for added taste. It does not hurt that it masks the smell of brains too. 

Love, E 

I was thinking of Dahmer as I wrote this. Sorry?
