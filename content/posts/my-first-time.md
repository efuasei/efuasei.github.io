### I don’t believe in love 🤷🏾‍♀️

Yes I’m sure. 

I won’t claim to have a lot of relationship experience but bruh. I have seen enough to make me not want to be in another. 

I mean yeah, love is beautiful and all. BUT. There’s too many uncertainties as to whether or not the relationship is going to be successful, and that’s not talked about enough! 

Will they die and leave you ? ☠️

Will they wake up one day and decide they don’t like the shape of your mouth anymore and so it’s over?

Will they fall in love with another? ❣️

Will they find more joy in another penis and or vagina?

Will the other woman be a squirter? 💦

And you know what’s more heart wrenching? 💔  No matter the effort you put in, nothing will make them stay when they make the decision to leave. It is always better to let them go. 🥲

You are really brave for being in a relationship. But it will end. 🤣. 

Call me a pessimist or prove me wrong. I will be waiting. ❣️
