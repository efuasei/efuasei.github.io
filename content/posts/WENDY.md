# Wendy’s milk jugs.

I didn’t notice it at first. 🤷🏿‍♀️ We were all kids or at least I thought I was. And then one day, it was all I could think about. 😑 Her boobs. Them jiggling in her shirt; when she walked in class ; when we played Ampe, when we marched to class from Assembly in the mornings singing Arise Ghana Youth. I’m pretty sure ghanaian youth weren’t the only ones arising . My non-existent deek was too, in solidarity. 🤠

She didn’t even have to be doing any activity. My eyes were devilishly glued on them. It was an obsession almost. An innocent obsession. 

You couldn’t blame me. I was pretty much as flat chested as the next boy. 

I particularly enjoyed playing opposite her in Ampe, because I got an unobstructed view of her huge mounds as they heaved and ho’d as she jumped… and she was a big jumper. 

Heaven..

I got away with ogling them for at least 2 weeks.. and then Friday between classes, the unfortunate happened. 

 She was speaking to me , enquiring about her exercise book she couldn’t find. 

For once , my position as the cupboard monitor had come in clutch. Thank you, Monsieur Bugri.

I relished the close range she had given me.. for i was sitting and she standing. My eyes and their fetish united. I struggled to follow what she was saying , but my sub conscious picked up on a few things, lest i made a fool of myself. I heard myself telling her not to worry, because i was the best at keeping my books in line, whatever that meant. She smiled at me and left. 

Tearing my eyes away, they met Kofi’s. A silent message passed between them in eye language, in the land of eyes. The message reached our lips , and then we both smiled. 

Break time came around and Kofi walked up to me, with that same knowing smile. 

K🙍🏿‍♂️: ‘Effy i cannot find my book too 😏”. 

E🙎🏿: ’Shut the fuck bro 😂

I smacked him and got up to leave for the canteen. He naturally tagged along like clockwork. 

K 🙍🏿‍♂️: I see what you’ve been doing,

 he said after we had settled in and was about to devour  our “tea blog”s  and cookies. 

E 🙎🏿: I don’t know what you’re talking about. 

I lied through my teeth , even as my breath hitched. 

K 🙍🏿‍♂️: Come on , Wendy??

E 🙎🏿: Yeah what about her? 

K 🙍🏿‍♂️:  You have been drooling all over her like a literal dog. 

E 🙎🏿: 😯

I let out a nervous laugh. Kofi could see I was stressing. There was smoke coming out of my ears literally. He told me to relax , he just found it fascinating that we both had the same tastes. I smiled a fake smile and asked him not to repeat  this to anyone under or above the sea… and that there was nothing more to it. 

Aside fixating on her mounds at every chance i get, i hadn’t given anything else much thought. I didn’t want to think about the implications of that . I didn’t tell Kofi this though. I was in a hurry to drop the conversation. 

He noticed my discomfort and decided to profit off of it. I had to buy him extra cookies .

My school was such that there were Sunday extra classes organized for the form 3’s . From 2pm to 5pm. 

The people that branded themselves serious students like me 😌 came earlier than 2pm to study. 

Wendy was never a part of us the ‘before 2s.’ But i arrived in the 3B class on Sunday at 12 🕐 to see her already seated. She was the only other person present. That was very sus.. but i thought nothing of it. 

She wore a bright yellow tank top, her mounds pouring over at the top, threatening to come out and play. I swear i could hear the buttons at the front of her tank top  squirming and screaming . They strained infront of her luscious front , struggling to keep everything in place. 

I could hear them calling out to me. Save us Effy 😭. Save USSSSSSS😭. 

My eyes lingered, and then i shook myself. 

I chose a seat as far away from her as possible. And then i heard an “oh “

It’s almost as if the Queen of buttons in the land of Buttons had heard my unuttered prayer and granted it.. Because the first button on Wendy’s tank had popped off. 

Conveniently, i had safety pins in my bag. Don’t ask me why ? I was the odd girl in the class that had all the miscellanous things. 

Need a solitape ? Go ask Effy.

Need a spare pen? Go ask Effy.

Need brown paper for your book? Go ask Effy. 

I was a walking mini mart…. but i digress. 

I turned around to look at her 👀 , she was struggling to hold her top together.The second button had come off.  

I fished for the pins🪡 in my bag and then i offered her some. She asked me to come around and help. 

She’d pull the top together while i put on the pins. I was hesitant at first but she smiled and said she doesn’t bite????? 

Okayyy?

Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥 .  I got up and walked to her desk . 

Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥 .  I put the pins on the table. 

Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥.   I reached out to touch the tops of her top.  A jolt run through me .

Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥.   My hands touched them . My eyes squealed and did a dancey dance..

I was transported into another universe, where it was just my eyes and her boobs. It was such a feast  and then ..

and then.. i felt it on my lips. I broke out of my reverie. She was kissing me ? 😱 My first kiss? I didn’t know how to respond. I was frozen.. 

She held my hands and guided them to my boobs. Soft, velvety, succulent, everything i had imagined and more.   All the while kissing me tentatively. I responded in the best way i knew.  I was in the moment and yet i was not? Was this really happening?

It may have lasted a minute, or a few seconds or an hour. All i know is it felt like an eternity and i knew i was home. 

I later found out , she wanted to date Kofi’s friend and Kofi had dared her to do this in exchange.

 I could kiss him if he hadn’t facilitated the removal of the last straight bone i had. 

That set rolling the many unorthodox sexual adventures Kofi and I embarked on, with each other and with others. 

 I just may tell you the rest, now that i have ripped opened the can. 

What do you want to hear about next? The threesome with our teacher? Muahahaaha 😈 😈

Love,

E 💞
