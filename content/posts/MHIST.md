# MY HOLE IS STILL TIGHT

**MY HOLE IS STILL TIGHT.**

🛐 ⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪⛪

Dear God, I don't know why I allowed myself to get here. I was Yours until him. He ruined me in ways I never imagined. If I'm being honest though, I enjoyed it too. I played an equal role. 😞

I grew up Christian; the ‘*helebaba*’ kind 🤼‍♂️. Daddy 👴🏿 was a priest in a church I cannot mention for reasons obvious. The woman from whose vagina I came had the job of an “*Osofo* mommy."

Fulfilling that obligation was more important to her than her own life.

To her, her “blessed ones” as she called the church members, were more important than the children born of her womb and who passed through her vagina.

🛐 🕴🏿

My brother and I 👫 were never to call her anything more than Reverend. And so “Reverend Ma” 👵🏿it was from the day we could talk.

We were born twins you see, into the cold walls of a church. Our fates were sealed. 🪶

*You may have to forgive my repeated use of the word, vagina.* *I need to get used to the taste of it in my mouth and be comfortable with its weight on my tongue. I have been starved of it for too long, but I digress*.

There are times I thought she didn’t possess a vagina herself, Reverend Ma. She would hush and shush at any mention of the ‘devilish’ words; no whispers of them, no words or thoughts of them, even though they were right there between our legs.

“Poise and Voice” she called our pee places.

👵🏿: “No touching of Poise and Voice! .. (even with our own hands. Nanny did all the touching)

👵🏿:” If you touch them, you will burn in raging hell fire 👺

👵🏿you will die by lightning the instant you do. I shall not present unclean children to God."

🛐 🐧

Daddy didn’t have a problem with Reverend Ma’s obsession with bringing us up on the straight and narrow. He told us it was good for us ? 💭

Now, I think he only repeated that mantra as a comfort to himself. He most likely was under her spell too.

Reverend Ma decided that “Public schools were filled with useless tutors with low quality brains.”

She often reiterated that she didn’t understand how people who were okay with such paltry salaries were fit to do their jobs efficiently. As for private schools, they were ballrooms for Satan’s subjects to parade their evil.

So, home-school it was.

My brother and I were home-schooled. No, it was bad. Don’t think it wasn’t.

🛐 ☄️

Home grown is the right word because we would only see other people at church. We were never allowed outside of the house for anything except church.

We lived in a prison 🏫, 5 meters away from the church building in the same compound. If we caught the evil, our doctor would treat us in the makeshift ‘hospital’ room Reverend Ma had created.

Even at church, the pastor’s kids had our own cubicle. In my head, we didn’t even qualify to be a part of Ma’s blessed ones. We were filthy.

We couldn’t so much as look the way of the other children, yet Reverend Ma would touch bodies with them in a weird way. She would put her arms around them and touch her lips to their cheeks and call them her children.

She never touched me and my brother that way. 🙅🏿‍♀️

Our nanny did all the touching.

🛐 👺

Nanny took care of our domestics but conveniently Nanny was a mute.

She couldn’t help me with my throbbing questions even if she was willing to. We were forbidden from learning sign language.

We learnt about everything there was to know under the sun, except of course about Poise and Voice. Well, everything meant whatever Reverend Ma did not put in her box of evil.

She supervised all of our classes.

When we went in ‘the way of sinʼ, we would self-flagellate. 7 strokes per sin.

My stroke buddy never left my back. I named it Kitty, because it was a pink furry long leather tail.

I had the unusual habit of asking too many wrong questions and so I would end each day with sores on my back. Nanny took care of me.

Kofi named his Tyrone. I do not know why.

Ma insisted that we name them; they were our pets, our companions that would guide us on the way to God. They were our spiritual guides.

🛐 🔊

**The sounds...**

I heard them. I was 18 and awake. My back was sore from all of Kitty’s lickings. I could not sleep.

They were coming from upstairs, and of course upstairs was a zone forbidden.

**The sounds..**

Kofi heard them too. I don't know what he was doing awake at that eerie hour, but I heard a tip-tap tip-tap on my door and I knew it was him. It was our secret knock.

Kofi and I had a telepathic connection. I am sure he’d heard my musings and knew I may be scared and thus had come to keep me company. My gallant protector.

**The sounds..** we’d heard them for years. They usually happened past midnight. I thought they were loud drums and cymbals. They added spice to my frequent nightmares. Kofi knew this and was always there for me. ❤️ What choice did he have?

🛐 🦴

**The sounds..**

Kofi was lying on the floor, at the foot of my bed playing an imaginary game with Tyrone. He’d occasionally slap his leg with Ty out of habit. I’m sure he had lost feeling in that part of his thigh.

The sounds had gone down, almost to a whisper, and then they started again. Kofi bolted upright with a sudden resolve.

🙍🏿‍♂️: I am going to check it out.

🙍🏿‍♀️: Reverend Ma will have your head, I started.

Kofi didn’t care, he left.

I started panicking, I held my knees to my chest and rocked gently. What if he didn’t come back? What evils lurked upstairs? What would Ma do to him if he was caught?

Surely though, there could be no evil where Reverend Ma existed. I let myself relax.

🛐 🤖

Kofi did come back in one piece after about 15 hellishly long minutes. I asked him what those sounds were that had tormented me for years.

He told me he did not have the words to describe what he'd seen, because he was not sure what it was. It would only make sense if I saw for myself too.

He promised me he was going to have my back, and that we would sneak in and out as fast as he did. He said nobody saw him. He’d make sure they did not see us too.

🙍🏿‍♀️:who were they??

He grew impatient.

🙍🏿‍♂️: Just come with me and stop being impertinent.

🛐 🫀

We were going against God. Reverend Ma and God were synonymous to me. I started praying for forgiveness as we made our way stealthily up the stairs.

I missed the sting of Kitty on my back. I would give myself 30 strokes as penance later, I promised God.

**The sounds..** I could hear them clearly now.

Praises?

The drums and cymbals sounded like our church choir. Why would our church choir be rehearsing past midnight in our house? Why did they not rehearse in church.? No, they did rehearse in church on Saturdays.

I looked quizzically at Kofi. He just shrugged and motioned that I quickened my steps.

🛐 👀

We entered the room through a sliding window. Kofi entered first, and then helped me in. We were well hidden behind thick red velvet curtains that dropped from the ceiling.

The first thing I recall seeing was the choir, adorned in full regalia, their purple and gold robes shimmered in the dimmed lights. The choir master stood in front with a frown as usual, his glasses balanced on the huge spectacle that was his nose. His conducting baton was in hand.

Mm. This was not so scary after all.

And then I saw them. I half expected to see a podium, daddy preaching, or at least going through his notes like he always did while Reverend Ma sat behind him, fan in hand.

I saw a king-sized bed instead.

🛐 🛌🏿

And then I saw two bodies, sweat glistening.

I saw a man’s behind. What in the world was going on?

He was moving in rhythm to the choral music, his buttocks scrunching in and out. Kofi moved me around so that I could see the view from the front.

—————————————————————————————————-

Reverend Ma and Daddy?

Reverend Ma was bended on all fours. She .. she was naked?

So those were how adult breasts looked like.

Daddy was moving behind her, he looked like he was in pain. I could not quite read the expressions on Ma’s face, she was floating between what seemed like pain and yet satisfaction.

🛐 🤭

The tempo of the choral music increased and so did Daddy’s frenzied movements.

It was almost comical.

Daddy humping away to *Makoma Mu Do Pa* by the choir.

The bed was in the center of the room, the choir had front row seats, almost as if they were in a boxing arena and they were the crazed fans.

It was very fascinating.

All 25 members of the choir plus the instrumentalists had their eyes trained on them. Singing in precise rhythm, their many years of rehearsals together apparent.

There was an eerie excitement in the air. The atmosphere was charged with something indescribably tense. Daddy’s humping quickened, the choir’s tempo increased accordingly.

Daddy’s waist and the choral voices Ying Yang-ing.

And then out of nowhere, Reverend Ma let out a horrendous scream and started spasming. The choir screamed too in unison. Daddy collapsed on top of her and Kofi dragged me out before we were caught.

🛐 👴🏿

I was filled with so many more questions, my head could literally burst.

Why was the choir seeing my parents naked?

Why was daddy naked behind Rev Ma?

They looked like they were touching Poise and Voice.

Were Ma and Daddy going to die? Is that why the choir was there.? To sing them to heaven?

I turned to Kofi with tears in my eyes.

“Mommy and Daddy are going to die, aren’t they?"

He said no.

🛐

When we got to my room, I was still hysterical. I wondered why Kofi seemed so calm. He pulled me into an embrace.

🙍🏿‍♂️: No, they are not going to die.

🙍🏿: But how do you know? I saw them touching their Poise and Voice! Daddy was shoving it inside mommy.

🙍🏿‍♂️: They weren’t touching those, I promise. I have seen them do it, several times in fact.

🙍🏿: What?!

🙍🏿‍♂️: I pushed him away.

🙍🏿:Why are you only now telling me then?

🙍🏿‍♂️:I didn’t want to scare you more than you have already been.

That made sense, I leaned back into his embrace.

🛐 ***i shall provide rest***

I almost fell asleep in Kofi’s arms, till he started rubbing me on my side. Just underneath my arm.

At first, I thought he was just trying to comfort me. Maybe he was, but as he kept rubbing me, I started getting a tingling sensation in my vagina.

It was new and it felt good, in a way I cannot describe. I wanted to move away, but my body would not budge. My brain was lost in the tingling.

He paused, I heaved a sigh of relief.

Then his hand started moving up and up, till it was just underneath my right breast. He slipped his hand into my shirt.

My breath hitched.

🛐 ***mmmph***

He raised my head so our eyes could meet, I saw his eyes seeking consent.

I gave it to him. He touched my lips with his. It felt freakishly good but oh so wrong.

But maybe, just maybe, this was the way of the Lord, for if Reverend Ma locked us in all our lives, then it must mean she and Daddy were brother and sister too.

Maybe, sons and daughters came from brothers and sisters.

Kofi seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He knew what would get me off because of our telepathy. Perhaps he must have seen more than he let me know, but I really couldn’t care a dime. His hand gently fondling my breast was all that mattered in the moment.

However, he painfully ignored the ache between my legs.

🛐 ***they that wait shall be fulfilled***

He touched his lips all over my face, and my ears and my neck. He sucked, and nibbled and pulled and licked per instinct. Same to my breasts, which he handled in the gentlest of manners.

Yet he never once lingered near my vagina. A trace to my navel and back up, was all I got. Frustrating.

I could see his Poise hoisted.

I made for it, and he swatted my hand away.

He fetched Kitty and told me to be a good girl or Kitty would assist him in giving me a good lashing on my buttocks.

Oh how I liked to be dared. I reached out for his Poise again. He chuckled. He knew I would.

He laid me over his laps and fed Kitty’s stings across my large behind. I decided I was never going to administer my strokes of penance on my back ever again.

My buttocks were promising land unexplored.

:

🛐 ***for he is with us in the rains***

My vagina was dripping. On a regular day, I would have been concerned, but on this day, the need I felt overshadowed whatever concerns my brain could conjure.

I begged Kofi to let us do what Ma and Da had been doing. He told me we couldn’t sin in the house of the Lord. And so we sat and figured out what the sins and non-sins were.

Sin

- we couldn’t touch Poise and Voice ….**with our hands**

Non-Sin

- Ma said nothing about touching P&V with other parts that are not hands.

Sin

- …

Non-Sin

………

🛐 ***pray for us sinners***

We figured out the holy ways and we got right to it.

I was more aggressive this time. Kofi let me have control. I entangled my legs around him and kissed him ferociously.

It felt like I had been waiting to do this all my life. Kofi decided he had enough and turned me over on the bed.

He was on top of me now. Our energies flowed through each other. This was more than met the eyes. He touched me in ways I didn't even know I wanted to be touched.

He fueled my need for him with every mild contact.

And then he got between my legs.

Careful not to touch my Voice with his hands, he buried his nose in deeply, like he wanted to imbibe my very essence.

🛐 ***now and at the hour of our death***

He began using his tongue in my Voice, he lapped at it up and down the length as if marking his territory, then he slowly eased into a groove he could maintain, all the while, teasing and pinching my nipples.

Then the most pleasurable sensation started building up in my loins. I started pushing my hips into his face, wishing he could double down on what he was doing.

He heeded my call, and soon I was sent over the edge.

I exploded into colors brighter than the rainbow. It was the most euphoric thing I had ever experienced.

I passed out, my body gave out from the overdose of ecstasy.

🛐 …

I woke up the next morning, smug. I radiated with the warmth from the previous night’s escapades. I was almost too shy to see Kofi when we went for our usual classes during the day.

He made sure I suffered for it too.😂

If Ma noticed anything, she did a good job at hiding it.I was itching for night to fall, and it fell heavily.

Tip-tap-tip-tap

Kofi at my door.

He opened it gently and peered in with half his face. He asked me how I was feeling. Then we proceeded to have a long conversation about the previous night.

We couldn’t care less what we saw the parents doing, and we decided we loved each other enough to explore more of our bodies in a holy way.

We wouldn’t want to incur the wrath of God.😞

🛐 🙂

This night too, like the previous night, Kofi showed me gentle ‘lorvings’, only going harder when I used my words.

**Sin: Do not touch Poise and Voice.**

Kofi turned me over and massaged the lubricant gently into me. It felt cool against my skin, it was almost ticklish. 🙃

He wiggled a finger inside, my hole was tight. He tried moving in and out slowly until I got comfortable with one finger.

He gave me more note-worthy orgasms this way in the following nights.

Adding a new finger every time I aced one level. Kitty was very much involved in ways I refuse to divulge.

Soon it was time.

I was open enough to receive him, the love of my existence.

🛐 🧘🏿‍♀️

He made sure I was slippery, then he put me on all fours.

Ass cheeks in the air, just like we had seen Reverend Ma. And then he got behind me. Just like we had seen daddy do.

And when he entered, it. was. heavenly.

I understand now why Ma and Da had the choir present, because what better music to levitate to?

Kofi would tie my hands together on my back with Kitty’s Lush tail. I was just happy to be there.

He’d trail Tyrone on my back and whip me when I was being insubordinate. That always managed to elicit more juice from my Voice. He liked how I tasted.

He’d drink of me. I was his spiritual elixir.

🛐 ☺️

He’d fuck me. Fuck, fuck is a nice word to say.

He’d fuck me in whatever way caught our fancy that day.

We had sessions where there was no Kitty or Tyrone. Just me and him and our intertwining bodies. And then there were days he’d fuck the shit out of me, and I would quite literally see stars. Those were my favorite days.

The scars on my butt cheeks increased exponentially, because I loved it when he punished me and I’d unnecessarily be stubborn just to get a good lashing.

I was sure Ma would be proud of all the penance I did.

I particularly enjoyed finding ways to please him. I couldn’t touch his Poise with my hands, that would be blasphemous. So I used my feet to get him off and I got very good at it too. 🙂

🛐 ***for i have sinned***

And when we got tired of Kitty and Tyrone, we would improvise with whatever we laid hands on.

Nanny started missing candles and cucumbers and ropes and bottles around the house. Of course, we knew nothing about it. Did you know something about it? Cause we sure as hell did not.

Nanny would sign to Reverend Ma about it, and she started getting suspicious.

Of course, Kofi and I were forbidden from learning sign language, but we picked up enough to know what was going on.

We mentally got ready for the hellish rage that loomed ahead.

🛐 🤟🏿

Hell, or was it?

The day of confrontation came.

Reverend Ma did not mince words when she had evil to cast out. The day began with penance, Kitty was given to Kofi.

He was “forced” to give me 50 lashes on my back and I, him.

My panties were soaked after that. It took all my willpower to not moan during the administration. I turned it into fake crying. I put on a good show for Reverend Ma.

She looked quite pleased with herself when I started whimpering.

We prayed for 2 long hours after that, to purge us, she said. She made us kneel in front of her, then she put her feet on our heads. One leg per head.

🛐 👽

And then came the confession.

She said to confess and be saved. We made up our sins as went.

“I forgot to water the houseplants on a Saturday, I did not do my assignments and blah.

She said God had revealed to her that we had touched Poise and Voice.

I burst out crying, because we truthfully had not. Why would God lie to her in this way?

I swore that we had not. I hadn’t the faintest idea what a Poise looked like.

Kofi was more civil. Reverend Ma would not have it.

She said she knew how to prove it, and if the results showed that we had, oh we would wish we had not been born.

I had wished that a few times already, so that did not sound bad.

🛐 🥶

She called for the doctor. Told him it was urgent business.

Our doctor arrived, and he was told to thoroughly examine my vagina for I had fallen in sin.

I was taken to the hospital room and stripped.

The doctor asked for Ma to leave so that he could be professional.

I got spread eagled on the examination table, each leg propped up.

The doctor wore a single white glove on his right hand, and made to touch my vagina.

I screamed and recoiled. I begged him that I did not want to die. He calmed me down . And asked that I tell him exactly why I thought so .

I explained . He shook his head sadly, and told me he would talk to Reverend Ma.

About what though? Could she prevent my death?

🛐 🤥

After hours of trying to explain to me , I finally gave up and positioned myself on the table.

I did not understand half of what he said, but being in the sick room had started getting suffocating.

Why wasn’t Kofi getting checked too?

The doctor inserted a lubed gloved finger in my vagina. I flinched.

I waited for my demise.

Lightening to strike my head? God was vengeful like that. According to Ma anyways.

A minute passed, two, and I was still alive.

The doctor wiggled around in me some more, it felt just weird.

He typed out a report for me to submit to Reverend Ma.

🛐 😎

I asked him what the verdict was. He said I was still very much a virgin.

He took his leave.

I got back to the confrontation room.

Ma snatched the letter from my hand . She still wanted the satisfaction of me

verbally confessing.

[👵🏿Rev.Ma](http://xn--rev-3s13b3q.ma/): So.. tell the truth now, what did the doctor say?

🙍🏿: My hole is still tight Ma. I have not being defiled.

She angrily tore open the letter, mumbled some things under her breath and left the room.

Kofi and I smiled at each other.

**Non -Sin : Poise and Voice should not be touched. But nothing was said of the mingling of Poise and Anus.**

🥂to butt stuff.

Love,
