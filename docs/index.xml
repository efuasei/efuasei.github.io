      <description>Wendy’s milk jugs. I didn’t notice it at first. 🤷🏿‍♀️ We were all kids or at least I thought I was. And then one day, it was all I could think about. 😑 Her boobs. Them jiggling in her shirt; when she walked in class ; when we played Ampe, when we marched to class from Assembly in the mornings singing Arise Ghana Youth. I’m pretty sure ghanaian youth weren’t the only ones arising .</description>

      <description>I don’t believe in love 🤷🏾‍♀️ Yes I’m sure.
I won’t claim to have a lot of relationship experience but bruh. I have seen enough to make me not want to be in another.
I mean yeah, love is beautiful and all. BUT. There’s too many uncertainties as to whether or not the relationship is going to be successful, and that’s not talked about enough!
Will they die and leave you ?</description>
