      <description>Talia and the Supagetti My Natalia,
She lay on the other side of the bed, breathing , softly.
Her chest rising ,almost not. She looked not evil.
She filled my brain with pictures of birds, green and red. Images of blue flowers swinging by their stalks on vines; multi-colored snakes wrapped in the vines.
Looking at her made me itch for my brushes. I wanted to paint on her skin.</description>

Dear God, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I allowed myself to get here. I was Yours until him. He ruined me in ways I never imagined. If I&amp;rsquo;m being honest though, I enjoyed it too. I played an equal role. 😞
I grew up Christian; the ‘helebaba’ kind 🤼‍♂️. Daddy 👴🏿 was a priest in a church I cannot mention for reasons obvious. The woman from whose vagina I came had the job of an “Osofo mommy.</description>

      <description>Wendy’s milk jugs. I didn’t notice it at first. 🤷🏿‍♀️ We were all kids or at least I thought I was. And then one day, it was all I could think about. 😑 Her boobs. Them jiggling in her shirt; when she walked in class ; when we played Ampe, when we marched to class from Assembly in the mornings singing Arise Ghana Youth. I’m pretty sure ghanaian youth weren’t the only ones arising .</description>
