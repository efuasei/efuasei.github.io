<p>I didn’t notice it at first. 🤷🏿‍♀️ We were all kids or at least I thought I was. And then one day, it was all I could think about. 😑 Her boobs. Them jiggling in her shirt; when she walked in class ; when we played Ampe, when we marched to class from Assembly in the mornings singing Arise Ghana Youth. I’m pretty sure ghanaian youth weren’t the only ones arising . My non-existent deek was too, in solidarity. 🤠</p>
<p>She didn’t even have to be doing any activity. My eyes were devilishly glued on them. It was an obsession almost. An innocent obsession.</p>
<p>You couldn’t blame me. I was pretty much as flat chested as the next boy.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed playing opposite her in Ampe, because I got an unobstructed view of her huge mounds as they heaved and ho’d as she jumped… and she was a big jumper.</p>
<p>Heaven..</p>
<p>I got away with ogling them for at least 2 weeks.. and then Friday between classes, the unfortunate happened.</p>
<p>She was speaking to me , enquiring about her exercise book she couldn’t find.</p>
<p>For once , my position as the cupboard monitor had come in clutch. Thank you, Monsieur Bugri.</p>
<p>I relished the close range she had given me.. for i was sitting and she standing. My eyes and their fetish united. I struggled to follow what she was saying , but my sub conscious picked up on a few things, lest i made a fool of myself. I heard myself telling her not to worry, because i was the best at keeping my books in line, whatever that meant. She smiled at me and left.</p>
<p>Tearing my eyes away, they met Kofi’s. A silent message passed between them in eye language, in the land of eyes. The message reached our lips , and then we both smiled.</p>
<p>Break time came around and Kofi walked up to me, with that same knowing smile.</p>
<p>K🙍🏿‍♂️: ‘Effy i cannot find my book too 😏”.</p>
<p>E🙎🏿: ’Shut the fuck bro 😂</p>
<p>I smacked him and got up to leave for the canteen. He naturally tagged along like clockwork.</p>
<p>K 🙍🏿‍♂️: I see what you’ve been doing,</p>
<p>he said after we had settled in and was about to devour  our “tea blog”s  and cookies.</p>
<p>E 🙎🏿: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>I lied through my teeth , even as my breath hitched.</p>
<p>K 🙍🏿‍♂️: Come on , Wendy??</p>
<p>E 🙎🏿: Yeah what about her?</p>
<p>K 🙍🏿‍♂️:  You have been drooling all over her like a literal dog.</p>
<p>E 🙎🏿: 😯</p>
<p>I let out a nervous laugh. Kofi could see I was stressing. There was smoke coming out of my ears literally. He told me to relax , he just found it fascinating that we both had the same tastes. I smiled a fake smile and asked him not to repeat  this to anyone under or above the sea… and that there was nothing more to it.</p>
<p>Aside fixating on her mounds at every chance i get, i hadn’t given anything else much thought. I didn’t want to think about the implications of that . I didn’t tell Kofi this though. I was in a hurry to drop the conversation.</p>
<p>He noticed my discomfort and decided to profit off of it. I had to buy him extra cookies .</p>

<p>My school was such that there were Sunday extra classes organized for the form 3’s . From 2pm to 5pm.</p>
<p>The people that branded themselves serious students like me 😌 came earlier than 2pm to study.</p>
<p>Wendy was never a part of us the ‘before 2s.’ But i arrived in the 3B class on Sunday at 12 🕐 to see her already seated. She was the only other person present. That was very sus.. but i thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>She wore a bright yellow tank top, her mounds pouring over at the top, threatening to come out and play. I swear i could hear the buttons at the front of her tank top  squirming and screaming . They strained infront of her luscious front , struggling to keep everything in place.</p>
<p>I could hear them calling out to me. Save us Effy 😭. Save USSSSSSS😭.</p>
<p>My eyes lingered, and then i shook myself.</p>
<p>I chose a seat as far away from her as possible. And then i heard an “oh “</p>
<p>It’s almost as if the Queen of buttons in the land of Buttons had heard my unuttered prayer and granted it.. Because the first button on Wendy’s tank had popped off.</p>
<p>Conveniently, i had safety pins in my bag. Don’t ask me why ? I was the odd girl in the class that had all the miscellanous things.</p>
<p>Need a solitape ? Go ask Effy.</p>
<p>Need a spare pen? Go ask Effy.</p>
<p>Need brown paper for your book? Go ask Effy.</p>
<p>I was a walking mini mart…. but i digress.</p>
<p>I turned around to look at her 👀 , she was struggling to hold her top together.The second button had come off.</p>
<p>I fished for the pins🪡 in my bag and then i offered her some. She asked me to come around and help.</p>
<p>She’d pull the top together while i put on the pins. I was hesitant at first but she smiled and said she doesn’t bite?????</p>
<p>Okayyy?</p>
<p>Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥 .  I got up and walked to her desk .</p>
<p>Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥 .  I put the pins on the table.</p>
<p>Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥.   I reached out to touch the tops of her top.  A jolt run through me .</p>
<p>Budum Budum ❤️‍🔥.   My hands touched them . My eyes squealed and did a dancey dance..</p>
<p>I was transported into another universe, where it was just my eyes and her boobs. It was such a feast  and then ..</p>
<p>and then.. i felt it on my lips. I broke out of my reverie. She was kissing me ? 😱 My first kiss? I didn’t know how to respond. I was frozen..</p>
<p>She held my hands and guided them to my boobs. Soft, velvety, succulent, everything i had imagined and more.   All the while kissing me tentatively. I responded in the best way i knew.  I was in the moment and yet i was not? Was this really happening?</p>
<p>It may have lasted a minute, or a few seconds or an hour. All i know is it felt like an eternity and i knew i was home.</p>
<p>I later found out , she wanted to date Kofi’s friend and Kofi had dared her to do this in exchange.</p>
<p>I could kiss him if he hadn’t facilitated the removal of the last straight bone i had.</p>
<p>That set rolling the many unorthodox sexual adventures Kofi and I embarked on, with each other and with others.</p>
<p>I just may tell you the rest, now that i have ripped opened the can.</p>
<p>What do you want to hear about next? The threesome with our teacher? Muahahaaha 😈 😈</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>E 💞</p>
