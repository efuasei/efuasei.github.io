<p>My Natalia,</p>
<p>She lay on the other side of the bed, breathing , softly.</p>
<p>Her chest rising ,almost not. She looked not evil.</p>
<p>She filled my brain with pictures of birds, green and red. Images of blue flowers swinging by their stalks on vines; multi-colored snakes wrapped in the vines.</p>
<p>Looking at her made me itch for my brushes. I wanted to paint on her skin.</p>
<p>I wanted to swoop some yellows and brush them gently across her stomach. Down to where the colors would merge in a pretty swirl.</p>
<p>I wanted to drip drop purple paint on her nipples , neon green too,  then spread the paint around her areola, not with a brush this time. My tongue maybe , or my finger. She’d love that.</p>
<p>The sun seeped in through the diagonal slashes in the wooden window. The fire in the sun lit up her locs, pretty.</p>
<p>I felt her touch me. She wanted cuddles.</p>
<p>I pulled her into me, thigh between her legs. She smiled. A satisfied cat. I wanted to paint her, but she would not let me up.</p>
<p>The first time we met was , yesterday , in the mall . I was heartbroken and on a grief shopping haul.</p>
<p>I bumped into her at the ceramics section. She was looking at mugs. We both reached out for the yoda mug. I got to it first, she looked like she wanted to cry.</p>
<p>I told her to have it. Then she asked for my number. We started talking afterwards. I invited her home.</p>
<p>Your typical love story. Now, I am in no mood to finish this?</p>
<p>Maybe one day inspiration will hit me.</p>
<p>Just know that I love her and I did not mean to bash her head in or fry her brains up for the spaghetti I’m eating now.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Add locust beans for added taste. It does not hurt that it masks the smell of brains too.</p>
<p>Love, E</p>
<p>I was thinking of Dahmer as I wrote this. Sorry?</p>
